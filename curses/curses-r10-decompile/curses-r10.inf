Amnesiac players, on the other hand, may like to use ~long~ (or ~verbose~) to give only long ones. Either kind can go back to the usual state of affairs with ~normal~ (or ~brief~).^^", "Simple typing mistakes can sometimes be corrected just by typing ~oops~ followed by the word you had intended to type, so for instance:^^    drop fish in buket^    oops bucket^^The game knows several useful abbreviations: i for inventory, ne for northeast (and so on), l for look, g for again, o for oops, x for examine, z for wait (short for ~zzz~ - sorry about that).^^", "You can sometimes enter larger objects you find. You might well be able to get in a tractor, for instance, though driving it around might be harder.^^", "From time to time, you will wish to speak to other people. If you only have a single word to say, you could use commands like^^    answer yes^    say boo to goose^^(Text in quotation marks is not allowed.)  The game will usually guess who you want to talk to if you miss off the name. A better way to talk, which allows more complicated remarks, is to use commands such as^", "^    goose, boo^    wine waiter, give me the bill^^though, of course, the waiter may have better things to do.^Some documents may be consulted in this game. For this, try commands such as^^    look up chlorine^    consult periodic table about argon^^", "You can give several commands in a row by use of ~then~ (or commas, or ~and~ in some contexts): so, for instance,^^    e, s, get fish then inventory^^", "There are, of course, many other commands for more specialised circumstances.

! 105582 (0x19c6e): "A large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is propped up against the west wall."
! 105650 (0x19cb2): "It used to hang in the downstairs landing, and the red, deranged eyes annoyed everybody who passed. Then Aunt Jemima picked up the ridiculous idea that it was by Sir Joshua Reynolds and had it valued. Happily it wasn't and, to cut a long story long, it ended up here."

! 106020 (0x19e24): "This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below. There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south."
! 106238 (0x19efe): "William Wordsworth once described poetry as emotion recollected in tranquillity. If so, hospitals must be full of people turning out verses about what it was like to fall off the roof of a high building. Perhaps it might be better not to join them."
! 106394 (0x19f9a): "The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.^^It is peculiarly cold here."

Apart from a cross painted on one wall and a padded floor (to absorb the noise), this spartan cranny is featureless. Nevertheless there is a spooky air of the supernatural about... A narrow crawl leads up into the chimney."

There are engravings of Alison's heroines: Christina Rossetti, Elizabeth Browning, Emily Dickinson and Queen Victoria, an unlikely quartet. The wallpaper is done out in a dice motif, and a square outline of sixes surrounds a rather small door leading back north into the attics.^^The room is provided with a comfortable bed, which looks very inviting."

! 107902 (0x1a57e): "A tiny balcony around Miss Alison's windows, offering fresh air, blue skies and a magnificent view over the gardens down to the droning motorway in the distance. The roof is too perilous to scale even if you had a good reason (which you haven't), so you had better go back north."

The mouse is quite large (almost a foot wide and tall), and has a big smile painted on its metal chassis. It has surprisingly modern circuitry in, though, and is even humming very faintly, so someone must have put some work in on it recently."
! 109560 (0x1abf8): "The bricking-up of this cellar seems incomplete, because there is a hole about ten or eleven inches across in the west wall. You peer at this with interest but nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for you to wriggle through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do you."

A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the warmth of the house.^^The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.^^You shiver with foreboding, but inexplicably feel that the map you're looking for must be somewhere near here."
! 110318 (0x1aeee): "This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.^^An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.^^Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west."
! 110668 (0x1b04c): "A space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October."

! 111518 (0x1b39e): "It is a frosty, clear night, but there is a scent of camp-fires burning in the distance. You are passing through the landscape as if a ghost, and all seems faintly unreal. To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen."
! 111732 (0x1b474): "This is the tent of a thin, reedy man who wears no uniform but has an obvious and commanding presence. He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior officers, scheming politicians and their like. They are keeping their distance from a trestle table at the north end of the tent."
! 111942 (0x1b546): "This is a kind of improvised shrine. A trestle table bears entrails, crude drawings sketched out on hide, and caged animals: draped beside it is a primitive tapestry of a bear reared up on its hind legs."
! 112070 (0x1b5c6): "An absolute essential."
! 112086 (0x1b5d6): "On the table is a heavy iron mascot of some kind."
! 112116 (0x1b5f4): "The mascot is in the shape of an ankh, with a lemniscus (or infinity) symbol moulded onto it."
! 112174 (0x1b62e): "You can almost smell fear here. A motley platoon of soldiers are sitting about the embers of a fire. None are talking or sleeping, and the false good humour of the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle. It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there is a strange light already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem unaware of it."
! 112408 (0x1b718): "A standing stone, perhaps a glacial erratic, stands here and on top of it is a shining blue stone, whose brightness almost blinds you. You feel irresistably drawn to it, and your hand reaches out..."
! 112530 (0x1b792): "In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you do not dare go east for fear of being recaptured by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens."

! 112788 (0x1b894): "On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose loading door is shut."
! 112824 (0x1b8b8): "You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew House Maze. A signpost reading ~To the Mosaic~ points east across the lawn."
! 113042 (0x1b992): "Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass, between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east). Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden least visible from the house."
! 113254 (0x1ba66): "East or west."
! 113264 (0x1ba70): "This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitor's shoes. It consists of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further."
! 113492 (0x1bb54): "From here you can only climb back up to the lawn."
! 113520 (0x1bb70): "A clearing at the edge of the garden, surrounded by walls and the privet hedges of the maze. To the east is the plane tree, to the west an opening in the wall makes a garage entrance and to the south is a small vegetable garden."

! 114706 (0x1c012): "The mural depicts an old bearded wise man following a star in the western sky. He has his right arm around an attractive young woman and holds a bundle of wands with his left hand. Around the border are astrological symbols of all kinds, from Tarot suits to zodiacal constellations."
! 114874 (0x1c0ba): "An eerie passage, running down from an opening at the north to murky depths in the south. The walls are jagged, uneven and decorated with bones. An unpleasantly stale, charnel odour drifts in through a gap to the west."
! 115006 (0x1c13e): "Well, perhaps ~sarcophagus~ is a little melodramatic, but it's that kind of moment. You are stooped over inside a stone tomb, stained and crumbled with decay, broken only by a crevice you crawled in by. It is a nightmarish place."
! 115148 (0x1c1cc): "A large, grisly cave, deep under the garden, dimly lit and eerie. Darkness curls around the natural pillars of rock like a mist: and there is a peculiar, vaguely familiar odour to it. The only obvious routes out are an uneven passage climbing to the north and a crawl west."
! 115314 (0x1c272): "You bumped into something unpleasant there."
! 115340 (0x1c28c): "The cartoonist Heath Robinson used to specialise in drawings of fantastically complicated machines of string, pulleys, levers, counterweights, cogs, mice running about on wheels and the like. Just such a contraption fills the west end of this room, though most of the workings are behind a glass wall which, although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The parts are very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.^^The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east."

! 115924 (0x1c4d4): "You half-stand, half-float in a golden, misty sphere perhaps ten yards across, which slowly spins. The centre, out of reach and somehow insubstantial, is an eight-by-eight lattice of oblong crystals, bathed in warm pearly light."

! 116660 (0x1c7b4): "This is a rampart on the hillside, a natural ledge leading east. Down below in the valley, rough cottages surround a church. Labourers toil in the fields, and a hay wain is being pulled across the river.^^Towering over you is a monstrously awful piece of architecture, a Folly. The freestanding tower has no appreciable purpose and no apparent entrance. The latter is just as well since it looks extremely unsafe."

You find yourself sitting at a table for one in the centre of the cafe floor. It is noisy, bustling and cheery, and a string quartet plays Strauss under the chattering of German voices. Your chances of attracting a waiter are very slight."

! 123540 (0x1e294): "It is a summary of the writings of a polemical monk called Gildas, and relates to events following the fall of the tyrant Vortigern at the turn of the fifth century A.D. After dark decades of pillage by Saxon mercenaries, Britain was reunited by Ambrosius Aurelianus and then defended at the Battle of Badon Hill, some time in the early years of the sixth century.^^This remarkable victory was of no religious significance, so Gildas does not dwell upon it. He tends only to mention bad kings and leaders, and then only to insult them. (Talking about Gildas is an excellent way to annoy an Anglo-Saxon historian.)  Nobody even knows where Badon Hill is any more, or anything else about it, although some students of Welsh poetry believe Ambrosius was the source of the legend of King Arthur."

! 124384 (0x1e5e0): "The geography is strangely familiar here. You are on a natural shelf on the hillside, overlooking the valley below. An all-but invisible cleft in the rock leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be traversed to the east.^^It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign of civilisation."
! 124672 (0x1e700): "The hillside is too steep."
! 124688 (0x1e710): "You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil war, and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing. From here you could cut across the hillside east to west, or slip in through a none-too-secure timber door."
! 124980 (0x1e834): "A stream runs past the villa and cascades down the hillside here, to join the river far below, near the Roman road which will, in 1500 years time, become the motorway which so spoils the view from your back garden. A rough ladder of wood lashed together with leather rests against the villa at the lowest point of the tiled roof."
! 125170 (0x1e8f2): "The shadowy cloisters of the villa's atrium. You disturb a fieldmouse, and hear the scratching of tiny claws on stone. Moonlight filters in from the central courtyard to the south, and a rotten timber door leads back north."

The central floor area is commanded by a beautiful Roman mosaic, quartered into individual scenes, around the edges of which are vents from the hypocaust. There is no roof over the courtyard, and the atrium is lit by moonlight."
! 125566 (0x1ea7e): "The four quarters show white-beards in the Forum, farmers in Italian fields, a military fortification and a grain ship unloading at Ossia."
! 125652 (0x1ead4): "Whatever function this spacious room once had, now it is evidently home to military men, for it is filled with crude armour, spears, rough blankets which are little more than animal hides. Fortunately for you the guards are absent."

! 126130 (0x1ecb2): "You are clinging perilously to the walls of the deep and dangerous well. You can hardly see a thing, even with the aid of the torch, but curiously enough you feel warm air blowing across you from the east."
! 126242 (0x1ed22): "Too risky. There might not be anything that way, for all you know."
! 126282 (0x1ed4a): "This very low almost-cellar underneath the atrium is a tiny access space for log fires which are kept going to provide a form of central heating for the villa. They are lit and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very warm by twentieth-century standards, but you have to admit it works.^^A tiny amount of light filters in from the vents in the roof; just enough to see by. The only way in seems to be the way you came."
! 126532 (0x1ee44): "The log fires are hot, and anyway the only way out large enough for you is back west."
! 126582 (0x1ee76): "A well-flagstoned forecourt at the villa entrance, surrounded by lesser wooden buildings. Some of these are in use as stables, and figures of men slip between them. You hide from sight, not wishing to draw attention to yourself. Up on the hill, where Meldrew House will one day be built, men on horseback can be seen circling the access track. For a deserted villa, this is certainly well-guarded."
! 126822 (0x1ef66): "Well, here you are, imprisoned again. This time the cell is a tent of stitched animal hides, perhaps twenty feet in diameter, supported by a central pole. You have no idea where the entrance is, because you were blindfolded on the way in. There is at least a dim light from the camp-fires outside the tent."
! 127000 (0x1f018): "This tent doesn't seem to have an exit, either."
! 127028 (0x1f034): "He is dishevelled, wiry and unconscious. He is also covered with dust and leaves, as if he has been lying down on his front outdoors for hours."
! 127116 (0x1f08c): "An unconscious Saxon spy is slumped on the ground. Occasionally faint noises can be heard from him."
! 127176 (0x1f0c8): "Luckily for you the tent, now collapsed, was hardly being watched at all, because all the attention is diverted to a ghastly ritual being carried out over beyond the camp-fires. But your luck cannot hold for long. You are so surrounded by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide. Things are, not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim."
! 127386 (0x1f19a): "Far, far too risky."
! 127400 (0x1f1a8): "An erratic glacial rock, which seems in the feverish firelight to make a natural dolmen, can be made out to the east, on the other side of an almost-extinguished campfire of hot coals."
! 127508 (0x1f214): "You stand beside the eerie dolmen, surrounded by the terrible noises and incantations of a druidic rite."
