After dark decades of pillage by Saxon mercenaries, Britain was reunited by Ambrosius Aurelianus and then defended at the Battle of Badon Hill, some time in the early years of the sixth century.^^This remarkable victory was of no religious significance, so Gildas does not dwell upon it. He tends only to mention bad kings and leaders, and then only to insult them. (Talking about Gildas is an excellent way to annoy an Anglo-Saxon historian.)  Nobody even knows where Badon Hill is any more, or anything else about it, although some students of Welsh poetry believe Ambrosius was the source of the legend of King Arthur.",
