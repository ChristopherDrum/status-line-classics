Changes from Curses r7 to r8
============================
The version of Inform is now 634, instead of 539 in r7
----------------------------
A bug with the attic trap door is fixed, so it doesn't say you discover the antique box every time.
----------------------------
Two new verbs: "shanti" and "diagnose". 
"Shanti" gives an XYZZY-type response
"Diagnose" is just flavor text, presumably added because it was a standard Infocom verb.

----------------------------
Several objects are given new synonyms.
There are a few minor changes in the object tree (some concealed objects are outside the tree at the start now)

Additional descriptions:
Alison's Room
The robot mouse
----------------------------
The Disused Observatory now displays some signs on the wall when the projector is on and the crystall ball is polished, diffracting the light according to the card placed in the projector.
----------------------------
4 new deaths are added when you bring the iron mascot back to the attic (in addition to the meteor death in r7)

One more warning message appears at turn 7 of carrying the mascot.
----------------------------
The Unreal City now has some random atmospheric messages around 40% of the time.

A pun is added for trying to enter the river: "Are you in Seine?  There is a river in between you and the boat."
----------------------------
The scoring for turning the calendar is switched to scoring for receiving a daisy necklace.
----------------------------
The deaths for entering the tarot world for the Fool, Grim Reaper, and Drowned Man are now fake deaths only.

Also, the 8 of Wands now has a message if you put it in the projector, instead of just not doing anything.
----------------------------
You now get a warning before two previous instadeaths:
    1) Entering the sea at Andromeda's Sacrifice
    2) Turning the dial in the Universe Control Room
----------------------------
You can visit Madame Sosostris more than once, so there is no unwinnable state if you do it too early.

Sosostris's card dealing is more interesting as well, with many random cards.
----------------------------
There's some additional HELP text.

There's also a new AMUSING help section when the game is won.
----------------------------
The well in the master game now handles 'enter well' identically to 'down'.
----------------------------
There are various obscure parser improvements.
----------------------------
