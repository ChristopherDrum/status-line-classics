# Wishbringer: The Magick Stone of Dreams (Solid Gold Edition)

## About *Wishbringer* for Status Line
This is part of the Solid Gold series from Infocom, which re-released older z3 games as z5 games with built-in Invisiclues hint system. This set of games required very little in formatting; mostly just the hint system:
- Zork 1
- Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
- Leather Goddesses of Phobos
- Wishbringer
- Planetfall

The entire storybook needed extensive reformatting, as well as various signage and notices throughout the land.

## The Game

Wishbringer is a 1985 interactive fiction game written by Brian Moriarty and published by Infocom.
