# Planetfall (Solid Gold Edition)

## About *Planetfall* for Status Line
This is part of the Solid Gold series from Infocom, which re-released older z3 games as z5 games with built-in Invisiclues hint system. This set of games required very little in formatting; mostly just the hint system:
- Zork 1
- Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
- Leather Goddesses of Phobos
- Wishbringer
- Planetfall

Planetfall also needed tweaks to computer system displays (a lot of games love having the player use computers in the game; I'm guilty of that myself, now that I think about it :/ ). Also, the song sung in *that scene* needed heavy re-formatting."

## The Game

Planetfall is a 1983 interactive fiction game written by Steve Meretzky and published by Infocom.
