But you just left the contractors to sort out all those boring fire prevention matters for themselves.^^They were a slap-dash firm, too, from what you remember.

To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen."

He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior officers, scheming politicians and their like. They are keeping their distance from a trestle table at the north end of the tent."

None are talking or sleeping, and the false good humour of the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle. It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place.

! 182988 (0x2cacc): "An eerie passage, running down from an opening at the north to murky depths in the south. The walls are jagged, uneven and decorated with bones. An unpleasantly stale, charnel odour drifts in through a gap to the east."
! 183120 (0x2cb50): "You appear to be standing on a wrought iron key."
! 183148 (0x2cb6c): "A figure-eight double ring, a long barrel and a finely-cut ten-groove claw: this is the ultimate in keys. It is superb."
! 183220 (0x2cbb4): "A long, winding, vile passage through the earth, running east to west. The distasteful odour grows stronger as you go east."
! 183296 (0x2cc00): "Well, perhaps ~sarcophagus~ is a little melodramatic, but it's that kind of moment. This must be somewhere under the old parish church. You are stooped over inside a stone tomb, stained and crumbled with decay, broken only by a crevice you crawled in by. It is a nightmarish place."
! 183468 (0x2ccac): "A large, grisly cave, deep under the garden, dimly lit and eerie. Darkness curls around the natural pillars of rock like a mist: and there is a peculiar, vaguely familiar odour to it. The only obvious routes out are an uneven passage climbing to the north and a crawl west."
! 183636 (0x2cd54): "You bumped into something unpleasant there."
! 183664 (0x2cd70): "The cartoonist Heath Robinson used to specialise in drawings of fantastically complicated machines of string, pulleys, levers, counterweights, cogs, mice running about on wheels and the like. Just such a contraption fills the west end of this room, though most of the workings are behind a glass wall which, although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The parts are very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.^^The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east."
! 183960 (0x2ce98): "The whole     wall is occupied by a bronze mirror, reflecting the room."
! 184004 (0x2cec4): "The north edge of the room is a big sheet of dull amber-coloured metal."
! 184048 (0x2cef0): "Someone rather good-looking (you can't help thinking) is reflected in the metal surface."
! 184104 (0x2cf28): "How tantalisingly valuable it seems."
! 184128 (0x2cf40): "Solid, heavy, reliable, out of reach on the other side of the glass."
! 184172 (0x2cf6c): "A treasure in every sense, but misted over, like condensation on a cold window. Odd shapes seem visible through the haze: a horse's head, castle walls, a priest's crook."
! 184280 (0x2cfd8): "Sitting on the grass, beside the well, is a glowing golden orb."
! 184320 (0x2d000): "You half-stand, half-float in a golden, misty sphere perhaps ten yards across, which slowly spins. The centre, out of reach and somehow insubstantial, is an eight-by-eight lattice of oblong crystals, bathed in warm pearly light."
! 184464 (0x2d090): "Images lurk about the array of oblong crystals."
! 184496 (0x2d0b0): "They are extremely hard to see and impossible to touch, as if you can only catch anything at all through the corner of your eye."
! 184572 (0x2d0fc): "You really should try to be more awestruck, for this is Merlin's cave, the hub of Creation. Every visitor perceives this place differently, according to his or her own myths and beliefs. Your particular creed being science, there is only a black metal one-metre cube with an unimpressive collection of gauges and dials. An aluminium staircase leads up."
! 184796 (0x2d1dc): "The lower, on, position is labelled ~Determinism~. The upper, off, position is labelled ~Chance~."
! 184860 (0x2d21c): "This flagstoned rampart on the hillside looks across the valley, down (unfortunately) to the motorway below. Coaches pass by, reminding you of the rapidly approaching time when visitors will have to be let in again for the summer. The only safe way to go is back east into the maze. To one side is a plaque."
! 185040 (0x2d2d0): "The hillside is too steep."
! 185056 (0x2d2e0): "A miniature plastic etching rests on the plaque."
! 185088 (0x2d300): "What's the point of a drawing so small it might almost be a playing card?"
! 185132 (0x2d32c): "No larger than a playing card, it depicts the Folly which used to stand on the hillside outcrop."
! 185188 (0x2d364): "This is a rampart on the hillside, a natural ledge leading east. Down below in the valley, rough cottages surround a church. Labourers toil in the fields, and a hay wain is being pulled across the river.^^Towering over you is a monstrously awful piece of architecture, a Folly. The freestanding tower has no appreciable purpose and no apparent entrance. The latter is just as well since it looks extremely unsafe."
! 185440 (0x2d460): "The hillside is too steep."
! 185456 (0x2d470): "Whatever you do, it'll always be a bean pole."
! 185488 (0x2d490): "A bean pole, of the kind used to grow climbing plants, rests against the side of the tower."
! 185540 (0x2d4c4): "At the top of the beanstalk, in amongst the clouds. There is no safe way to go from here except back down, not surprisingly. A dangerous way might be to step out onto the clouds to the north, but even if this is a fairy-tale it would be taking a lot on trust."
! 185692 (0x2d55c): "The clouds are too tenuous that way."
! 185716 (0x2d574): "A square grid of plots of grass and seedbeds, all alike."
! 185752 (0x2d598): "Capability Meldrew and his gang of workmen are delicately planting a sapling plane tree here. Your disturbance annoys them immensely and you are immediately arrested for vagrancy and theft. After a few months in prison, you are hauled up before the County Assizes and sentenced..."
! 185924 (0x2d644): "The Museum of Arcana is deserted after nightfall and only dimly lit by distant sodium street-lamps. Outside it is a stormy October night, and rain beats against the windowpanes. Shadows swoop and dive in the air like bats.^^The revolving door to northeast, which leads out, seems to be solidly blocked off. But a dim passage runs south, through a strange metal corridor."
! 186152 (0x2d728): "There's no apparent way but south."
! 186172 (0x2d73c): "A publicity poster is displayed for passers-by outside to see."
! 186212 (0x2d764): "One of those pretentious exhibition posters. Your German is just about adequate to the task:^^~Cults of the Druids - a Major Retrospective, October-November 1988~."
! 186324 (0x2d7d4): "Inside one quarter of the cramped revolving door, which is blocked off from the world outside and opens only onto the foyer, southwest."

! 186548 (0x2d8b4): "A colourful, striped inflated beach ball bounces around in the door."
! 186592 (0x2d8e0): "A great square gloomy room, just south of the foyer. There are square lintelled doorways east and west. The storm is dark, and the windows are high, but there's just enough light to see by."
! 186704 (0x2d950): "There's nothing worthwhile in it."
! 186724 (0x2d964): "Resting on a little display table is a Tarot box."
! 186756 (0x2d984): "A long painted still life graces one wall near a corner."
! 186792 (0x2d9a8): "A disturbing painting, perhaps by Edvard Munch, this is a still life of a seedling on a table, surrounded by a rusty iron rod with a star on the end, a glass bottle, a lamp and a bunch of keys. No doubt these arcane objects held some special significance for primitive tribes now absorbed into civilisation."
! 186980 (0x2da64): "A dark staircase, turning from east to south as it descends. The hideous sound of rhythmless chanting can be heard from below."
! 187056 (0x2dab0): "On one step, an empty matchbook lies discarded."
! 187088 (0x2dad0): "Ah, I fear it is only a token clue."

! 187212 (0x2db4c): "Ugh, what a nasty bright light. Good thing you'll never go there."

! 187360 (0x2dbe0): "It shows a great many crystal-glass cups and glasses."
! 187396 (0x2dc04): "An old administrative office of the museum, emptied and made into a prison cell: amateur but effective."
! 187460 (0x2dc44): "There's definitely no way out of here."
! 187484 (0x2dc5c): "Just a crook. And what's wrong with crooks, that's what I say."
! 187528 (0x2dc88): "The door to the south stands open."
! 187548 (0x2dc9c): "As you might expect, the cell door is closed."
! 187576 (0x2dcb8): "This is a city side street, but as if seen through the grey of despair. People stream by, some of whom you almost recognise, as if dead. The street runs east-west, and to the north is a doorway into a grubby tenement building."
! 187716 (0x2dd44): "This shambolic flat, which extends to the east, shares a filthy hallway with the one upstairs. To the south, passers-by pass by along the street. Peeling-away posters have been stuck up on top of each other on the walls, in such a way that you can only read the most recent."
! 187876 (0x2dde4): "~Bateaux Phlebas - toujours le dernier mot~. You briefly wish you had a dog called Toto, so as to be able to say ~Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in England any more.~"
! 187988 (0x2de54): "What a very useful piece of paper. Pity there's writing on it."
! 188032 (0x2de80): "Flats occupied by starving-but-noble artists can be romantic and stylish despite the squalor. This one, however, is simply a one-room hovel, caked with paint, littered with brushes and improvised easels, and you can't help standing on tiptoe here."
! 188184 (0x2df18): "The stairs end at a shabby room, with screened windows, lit by incense sticks and sevenbranched candelabra. A doorway with a hanging bead curtain leads west. In the centre of the room is a table, on which is an electric bell push and a wicked Tarot pack."
! 188336 (0x2dfb0): "She has a bad cold, but nevertheless is known to be the wisest woman in Europe."
! 188388 (0x2dfe4): "Hood, scythe, skeleton, implacable grin: yes, it's the Reaper all right."
! 188436 (0x2e014): "It's vital you slide right along with this one."
! 188468 (0x2e034): "Don't worry, he won't slide down the cliff."
! 188496 (0x2e050): "The Fool is a man looking directly ahead as he steps off the edge of a cliff."

! 188572 (0x2e09c): "Those are pearls that were his eyes..."
! 188600 (0x2e0b8): "Shoddy workmanship, but never mind, it's only a staff and who needs those any more?"
! 188656 (0x2e0f0): "Down at the end of the street, the brown urban waters carry by unpleasant rubbish, and rats scuttle up and over the mounds washed up around you."
! 188744 (0x2e148): "People had no style in those days, before they invented paper tissues. I mean this tatty cloth wouldn't attract anyone, would it?"
! 188828 (0x2e19c): "On one especially repellent mound is, of all things, a fine silk handkerchief."
! 188876 (0x2e1cc): "Monogrammed J. A. P., but that's no great matter."
! 188908 (0x2e1ec): "The side reads: PHLEBAS."
! 188932 (0x2e204): "Moored close to the bank is a glass-roofed tourist boat."
! 188968 (0x2e228): "On the far bank is a glass-roofed tourist boat. As much as you like to explore, you can't see how to attract its attention."
! 189044 (0x2e274): "A tourist river-boat, glass-roofed. You can climb out to the shore to the east. At the helm is a very strange man, at times almost a straw dummy, almost perhaps a hollow cut-out made of paper. He (or it) turns the wheel and casts his eyes to windward."
! 189200 (0x2e310): "Every now and then he whimpers."
! 189220 (0x2e324): "The hollow man mechanically says: ~Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a real place, like anywhere was real... We are the hollow men, I says, he didn't like that... Hurry up, please, it's time.~"
! 189452 (0x2e40c): "A dry, desolate waste of buildings borders here on a main road, so full of black-suited pedestrians off to work at banks that you can't force your way any further east. Once in a while a few of the bowler-hatted army step into the street and down some steps below a Metropolitan sign."
! 189628 (0x2e4bc): "You can't force your way through the tide of bankers."
! 189660 (0x2e4dc): "This is a vast underground station in great rectangular caverns, deep beneath the streets. You are outside the ticket gates, near a flight of steps back up to the city, and since you haven't a ticket you're likely to stay that way."
! 189796 (0x2e564): "Back up the stairs for you. Call yourself a traveller..."
! 189832 (0x2e588): "Behind a kiosk, a surly-looking man is selling guide books and maps."
! 189876 (0x2e5b4): "His jumper is unstriped, and there are no onions around his neck. Nonetheless he has a rather Gallic, disgruntled look to him. Perhaps he's a former Socialist cabinet minister."
! 189988 (0x2e624): "Burn it!  Burn it at once!"
! 190008 (0x2e638): "What a very useful map!  Now you can go on holiday."
! 190044 (0x2e65c): "Just the way you remember yours having been."
! 190072 (0x2e678): "This crowded, bohemian cafe bears only a passing resemblance to the ruined castle of the Tarot card: the decor imitates castle walls and arrowslits. You find yourself sitting at a table for one in the centre of the cafe floor. It is noisy, bustling and cheery, and a string quartet plays Strauss under the chattering of German voices. Your chances of attracting a waiter are very slight."
! 190300 (0x2e75c): "The crowd is lively and exciting, but also inconsiderate and bulky."
! 190344 (0x2e788): "It contains a timer-detonator, a bundle of plastic explosives and many, many wires. The most obvious ones are green, red, blue and black. They would pull out of their loose sockets in the timer easily, so perhaps this bomb disposal nonsense isn't as tricky as people make out."
! 190516 (0x2e834): "Taped loosely to the underside of the table is a complicated-looking bomb."
! 190560 (0x2e860): "Time flies down here, you know. Eternity simply breezes by."
! 190600 (0x2e888): "Good photographic gear that. You didn't get it from a... well, a bomb, I hope."
! 190652 (0x2e8bc): "This basement room is filled with crate after crate of glasses and cups, enough for an entire hotel, or restaurant perhaps. Almost anything might be hidden among them. A little light comes in from an opaque skylight which is at street level outdoors. There is no way out of here, since the only door is shut tight."
! 190836 (0x2e974): "There's no apparent way out of here."
! 190856 (0x2e988): "Old, unwanted, dusty, empty."
! 190876 (0x2e99c): "The great challenge, of course, is to get a ship inside."
! 190912 (0x2e9c0): "An unlabelled whisky bottle, laid on its side and mounted on a wood plaque, lies deservedly unwanted on one of the crates."
! 190988 (0x2ea0c): "Oh, well done!  Why not take a closer look, you deserve it?"
! 191028 (0x2ea34): "Within the whisky bottle is a model sailing ship, far too large to have passed the neck."
! 191080 (0x2ea68): "The great challenge, of course, is to get it inside a bottle."
! 191116 (0x2ea8c): "A superb model sailing ship, about six inches from prow to stern, immaculate in every detail from an anchor on a filigree chain to a carved mermaid up front."
! 191212 (0x2eaec): "The great challenge, of course, is to get it inside a bottle."
! 191248 (0x2eb10): "A tightly-folded bundle of sticks, about six inches long, with a filigree chain and anchor hanging from it."
! 191312 (0x2eb50): "A rough rocky sea shore below barely-climbable cliffs, against which an inviting deep blue sea laps. It seems to be early morning, soon after dawn, from the look of the sun on the water."
! 191424 (0x2ebc0): "The rocks are too dangerous. You'll have to scale the cliff."
! 191460 (0x2ebe4): "Chained to the cliff face is the beautiful Andromeda, looking nobly out to sea as she awaits her fate."
! 191520 (0x2ec20): "Andromeda's"
! 191532 (0x2ec2c): "A long clasp of amber, perfect for long straggly Greek hair."
! 191572 (0x2ec54): "Mmm... it still has her perfume on it. Hehehehe. Bet she's dead now."
! 191620 (0x2ec84): "On top of some exposed cliffs on the Mediterranean. A dangerous slither down leads on one side to the shore, all other ways down being even more hazardous. Atop the cliffs is the Pharos tower, a round stone pinnacle lighthouse, but there is no way in from here.^^A grassy walk leads east, and a narrow crack leads southwest into a cave mouth."
! 191828 (0x2ed54): "There's only dull grassland that way."
! 191852 (0x2ed6c): "A long clifftop walk by the sea, from the lighthouse to the west to the village not far east. These fields are occupied by herds of hardy mountain goats, continually butting each other and frisking. To the south a path leads across sparse grassland to a great outgrowth of some kind."
! 192016 (0x2ee10): "There's only dull grassland that way."
! 192040 (0x2ee28): "The rather sparse rolling landscape is dominated here by a massive, and suspiciously unnatural, wall of thorns, which forms a great ring about an area perhaps a hundred yards in diameter. There are goat pastures to the north."
! 192172 (0x2eeac): "There's only dull grassland that way."
! 192196 (0x2eec4): "A ragged gap in the wall has been burnt out to the south."
! 192228 (0x2eee4): "The wall rustles and clashes its thorns like a beast alive."
! 192264 (0x2ef08): "It's hard to imagine what could possibly shift a wall like that."
! 192304 (0x2ef30): "Here inside the thorn wall, a north-south path leads across sacred earth into the imposing marble Temple of Zeus. You feel distinctly uneasy walking on such hallowed turf. There are any number of myths about gods getting cross about that sort of thing."
! 192460 (0x2efcc): "The wall of thorns hems you in."
! 192480 (0x2efe0): "The beautiful candle-lit Temple of Zeus, a cavern of marble pillars which is quite empty and featureless save for the entrance at the north. So much for all the rumours about hoards of treasure - it looks as if Zeus (who is, by the way howling with anger outside) was bluffing all along.^^Cloisters lead southeast and southwest, deeper into the temple."
! 192696 (0x2f0b8): "one"
! 192700 (0x2f0bc): "On one side, a man's face: on the other, a symbol, I. One obol, or one-sixth of a drachma."

! 192808 (0x2f128): "A long walk along the cliffs from the lighthouse leads naturally here, just outside the Eraina Taverna, whose open doorway lies to the south."

! 192912 (0x2f190): "Only a small, thorny, unclimbable fig tree."
! 192940 (0x2f1ac): "A plain but cheery taverna, fill of miserable and rather ashamed men who are drinking retsina heavily. The day is dawning outside the north door, but they strangely do not share your uplifted feeling at the sight."
! 193072 (0x2f230): "The tavern entrance is to the north."
! 193096 (0x2f248): "A speciality dessert of the Taverna: ice cream, kateifi, raspberry sauce, cream. An acquired taste."
! 193164 (0x2f28c): "Left untouched on one table is an Ekmek Special dessert."
! 193204 (0x2f2b4): "Better with chocolate ice cream, I think."
! 193232 (0x2f2d0): "Doesn't somebody else need this more than you?"
! 193264 (0x2f2f0): "Morose and unconvivial at the best of times. This is not the best of times."
! 193308 (0x2f31c): "Behind the bar, a depressed bartender polishes glasses."
! 193344 (0x2f340): "You stand atop a pinnacle of stone, on an early Pharos, or lighthouse. Considerately enough, the builders have provided a spiral staircase down.    ^^In the centre of the pinnacle is a marvellous device of polished bronze mirrors, its open end pointed out across the bay.    "
! 193512 (0x2f3e8): "Being a lighthouse, this pinnacle is way up in the air. Point taken?"
! 193556 (0x2f414): "A brown-tinted frieze, depicting hunters and spear-carriers, surrounds this dark stair-well, which has no exit except for a spiral staircase leading back up."
! 193656 (0x2f478): "This is a murky hillside cave, whose mouth opens to the northeast, though a tight squeeze might lead a little way west. Outside is a clear starry night. There is no traffic noise, and the air smells fresh."
! 193776 (0x2f4f0): "Hanging up on an iron bracket is a flaming torch."
! 193808 (0x2f510): "It is a summary of the writings of a polemical monk called Gildas, and relates to events following the fall of the tyrant Vortigern at the turn of the fifth century A.D. After dark decades of pillage by Saxon mercenaries, Britain was reunited by Ambrosius Aurelianus and then defended at the Battle of Badon Hill, some time in the early years of the sixth century.^^This remarkable victory was of no religious significance, so Gildas does not dwell upon it. He tends only to mention bad kings and leaders, and then chiefly to insult them. (Talking about Gildas is an excellent way to annoy an Anglo-Saxon historian.)  Nobody even knows where Badon Hill is any more, or anything else about it, although some students of Welsh poetry believe Ambrosius was the source of the legend of King Arthur."
! 194312 (0x2f708): "An uncomfortable spur of rock on the hillside crags. The only natural access to this spot is a crevice in the hill to the east, but there is also a securely fastened rope hanging down into the darkness."
! 194432 (0x2f780): "The crags are too precipitous."
! 194452 (0x2f794): "You are hanging perilously on a hemp rope, suspended from an overhang of rock above, which drops down into the darkness of the valley. On the tracks below, patrols of men can be heard, and you feel instinctively that they are not friendly."
! 194596 (0x2f824): "Up and down are it, quite frankly."
! 194620 (0x2f83c): "A single yellow daisy grows from a little tuft of grass on the crags."
! 194660 (0x2f864): "The geography is strangely familiar here. You are on a natural shelf on the hillside, overlooking the valley below. An all-but invisible cleft in the rock leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be traversed to the east.^^It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign of civilisation."
! 194948 (0x2f984): "The hillside is too steep."
! 194964 (0x2f994): "You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil war, and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing. From here you could cut across the hillside east to west, or slip in through a none-too-secure timber door."
! 195256 (0x2fab8): "A stream runs past the villa and cascades down the hillside here, to join the river far below, near the Roman road which will, in 1500 years time, become the motorway which so spoils the view from your back garden. A rough ladder of wood lashed together with leather rests against the villa at the lowest point of the tiled roof."
! 195448 (0x2fb78): "The shadowy cloisters of the villa's atrium. You disturb a fieldmouse, and hear the scratching of tiny claws on stone. Moonlight filters in from the central courtyard to the south, and a rotten timber door leads back north."
! 195576 (0x2fbf8): "Resting against one pillar is a horn made from a tusk, mounted on a long spear-like pole."
! 195632 (0x2fc30): "The central well of the villa, ringed with columns. On the north side is a cloister and stone-linteled doorways lead east, south and west. The central floor area is commanded by a beautiful Roman mosaic, quartered into individual scenes, around the edges of which are vents from the hypocaust.
