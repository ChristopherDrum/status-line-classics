# Leather Goddesses of Phobos (Solid Gold Edition)

## About *Leather Goddesses* for Status Line
This is part of the Solid Gold series from Infocom, which re-released older z3 games as z5 games with built-in Invisiclues hint system. This set of games required very little in formatting; mostly just the hint system:
- Zork 1
- Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
- Leather Goddesses of Phobos
- Wishbringer
- Planetfall

This game required various formatting changes to pre-formatted text (Sultan's riddle). A larger global formatting change to the number of spaces used for paragraph indents was applied. 3 is too wide for our small screen, so those were changed to 2. I think I caught them all, but indentation wasn't a function, it was part of the actual strings so I manually changed each one.

## The Game
