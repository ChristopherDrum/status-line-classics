Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out,
umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You
try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic
continues to the southeast.

>get parcel, medicine
gift-wrapped parcel: Taken.
guaranteed-unbreakable medicine bottle with a child-proof lock: Taken.

Attic

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

You can also see a crumpled piece of paper here.

>n

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-
made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good
strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues
along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed and contains a nasty-
looking red battery and a tourist map) here.

As you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the
demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards.
Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you
going to get it back?

>e

Storage Room
A disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous
dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a
handle on.

Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.

>turn wheel off
You switch the wheel off.

>turn wheel
It spins round smoothly, and the dumbwaiter is hoisted away out of sight.

>put medicine in shaft
It disappears into the darkness, and there is a slight cracking noise.

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to
potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has
filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made
calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is
cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear
the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen
you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

>turn calendar
You turn over to July and a watercolour painting of some green-edged hedgerow
daisies.

>s

Airing Cupboard
A space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic
sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is
filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous
Sixties Revival period of last October.

>search sheets
Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless,
now exposed to the light for the first time in months.

>turn wireless on
Nothing happens.

>push wireless n
It moves easily on the casters.

Aunt Jemima's Lair

Potting Room
This light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and
other miscellaneous garden implements.

A pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.

Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her
regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.

>unwrap parcel
You tear open the parcel to find a box of chocolates and a card.

>give box of chocolate to jemima
Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and
persuades you to have an unappetising toffee cracknell. "Now", she says, "Your
turn for a daisy chain!"

You try to look pleased.

"Let's see, the others have had theirs... I have only a few colours left. What
would you like?"

>answer yellow
(to Jemima)
"Right you are then, I'm sure I have some which are just right."

After a moment she notices you're still here. "Come back later, it'll be done
soon."  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile. Should have eaten the
chocolates myself, you find yourself thinking.

Execrable music begins to sound from the conservatory, and Aunt Jemima hums
vacantly.

>get gloves
Taken.

>wear gloves
You put on the old gardeners' gloves.

Aunt Jemima's Lair

The wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, "Mild-n-Breezy FM",
about which the least said the better.

The radio plays a easy-listening arrangement of Bill Haley's "Rock Around the
Clock".

Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area.
The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway
leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

>e

East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft
insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that
was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before
winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are
dark.

In the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.

The torch flickers ominously.

>search rolls
You uncover a shiny new battery. It must have been dropped by accident when the
loft insulation was being done.

>open torch
The torch goes out as you open the battery compartment.

>get old battery

>drop it
Dropped.

>get new battery

>put new battery in torch
You put the new-looking battery into the electric torch.

>close torch
You close the battery compartment of the torch, and it lights up brightly.

>s

Dead End
The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too,
what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney-sweeping gear.

Great Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous
ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambeze
Expedition of 1882!

Dark Room
This is a roughly-furnished photographer's dark room, used by your grandfather
years ago. There's nothing much here now, since you threw the chemicals out in
case the children found them.

You bump your head on the cord hanging from the ceiling, for the umpteenth time.

Mounted on a plaque is an old sepia photograph of a man.

A rather more modern photographer's flash lies on a shelf to one side.

>pull cord
Click!  A developing lamp comes on, emitting an eerie red light.

>look at postcard
It is addressed to the house, and postmarked 1963, but has no message. Odd,
that.

No... wait. The eerie lamp-light is bringing out a message in invisible ink:

   Hamburg 1420

>pull rope
You begin moving, and then plummet, but friction gradually slows you down and
you land without too much of a thump...

Cellars (in the dumbwaiter)
Cobwebbed old cellars. There is nothing to see except an opening in one wall
onto a dark shaft, and a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel beside it with a
handle on. The cellar continues west and south.

The dumbwaiter hangs on strong pulley ropes which stretch up and down from here.

In the dumbwaiter you can also see a guaranteed-unbreakable medicine bottle with
a child-proof lock (which is open but empty).

>stand
You are on your own two feet again.

Cellars

Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.

In one corner is a dust-covered robot mouse.

You can also see an old timber prop here.

>get prop

Taken.

>wave it
Light pulses around the daisy chain, then leaps out to engulf the old timber
prop which melts into the Rod of Returning!

>mouse, s
The mouse runs off as ordered.

>s

Cellars South
The bricking-up of this cellar seems incomplete, because there is a hole about
ten or eleven inches across in the west wall. You peer at this with interest but
nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for you to wriggle
through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do you.

You can see a robot mouse here.

>mouse, w
The mouse just squeezes through the hole, and disappears from view.
Unfortunately you can't very easily talk to it now...

>hole, w

Dark Shaft (in the dumbwaiter)
Halfway up, or else halfway down, and a dreary place it is too: nothing but a
dark corridor leading north.

In the dumbwaiter you can also see a guaranteed-unbreakable medicine bottle with

Inside Cupboard
This is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting
before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room for
something...

A large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is
propped up against the west wall.

Above you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle.

You can also see a gas mask here.

>get mask, painting
gas mask: (putting the red tablet into the rucksack to make room)
Taken.
painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe: (putting the Rod of Returning into the rucksack

Taken. (There's a fireplace behind it, by the way.)

>drop painting
Dropped.

>turn crank
With a horrid creaking noise, the crank winds open the skylight, flooding the
room with sunshine.

>u

Roof
This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below.
There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down,
and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is
vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that
there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south.

>nw

Battlements
The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of
course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-
looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't
intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.

It is peculiarly cold here.

You can see a gothic-looking iron key here.

>get key
(the gothic-looking iron key)
As you reach for the key, a swirling mist condenses about it, into a ghostly
head which opens its mouth and eats up the key!  The rest of the ghostly body
solidifies about the head and rises to swagger before you.

The ghost laughs in a gurgling kind of way, as it were always coughing and
spluttering.

>give wishbone to ghost
The ghost swallows the wishbone, grinning nastily. Then a look of consternation
spreads across his face. He begins to choke and as he fades away, his arms
flailing wildly, he lets go of the key, which sails through the air onto the
roof and (against all odds) falls neatly down a chimney.

Priest's Hole
Good heavens, so the house has a priest hole after all!  It was always a family
legend but nobody seemed to know quite where it was. Apart from a cross painted
on one wall and a padded floor (to absorb the noise), this spartan cranny is
featureless. Nevertheless there is a spooky air of the supernatural about... A
narrow crawl leads up into the chimney.

Low down on one wall is little hatch door, which if it were open would be large
enough to enter.

The dust and grime on the floor almost obscures an ancient prayer book.

You can also see a sooty old stick, a canvas rucksack (which is open and
contains an electric torch (providing light) (which is closed), a small brass
key, a gas mask, the Rod of Returning, a red tablet, an antique jewellery box
(which is closed), the History of the Meldrews (vol. II), a photographer's flash
(which is closed) and a postcard of the Champs-Elysees) and a gothic-looking
iron key here.

Cellar West
The west end of a disused and shadowy old cellar. It used to be a wine cellar,
but was bricked up when you were a child - you never did find out why. Perhaps
the golden, jewelled staircase leading down into smoky mists to the south might
be something to do with it.

In the northwest wall is a heavy, imposing Gothic iron door.

(first taking the tourist map)

At that exact grid reference is Meldreustrasse, a minor back street which houses
a museum of arcana.

Suddenly you remember!  You visited the place once, and the curator Doktor Stein
showed you round... and he hypnotised you into a swirl of unconsciousness...


Museum of Arcana
A dark hall, deserted after nightfall. Outside it is a stormy October night, and
rain beats against the windowpanes. Shadows swoop and dive in the air like bats.

You can see a Tarot box (which is closed) here.

>get box

>strike rod of returning
The rod charges up with etherial power, drawn up from the earth through ley

>z

>z

Doktor Stein appears and steps toward you, clapping his hands sharply. Suddenly
dozens of robed figures leap out of the darkness. Their faces are painted
hideously and they betray no emotion as they pinion you tight...

Stein forces your mouth open and makes you swallow a violet pill. "One of your
apothecary ancestors made this drug!  Appropriate, no?"

You feel queasy, but this is perhaps the least of your problems as they drag you
off...


Coven Cell
An old administrative office of the museum, emptied and made into a prison cell:
amateur but effective.

As you might expect, the cell door is closed.

You can also see an anxious-looking goat and a shepherd's crook here.

>eat tablet
It tastes alarmingly of chocolate.

>get crook

>point returning at me
You are engulfed in a cloud of spinning white lights, like insects. When the

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it
leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof. A circular mural painted
with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading
up to the north, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the
stairs down and to the south.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

>w

Library Storage
Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted
books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny.

You can see a romantic novel and a book of Twenties poetry here.

>read novel
"Coronets for the Cotton Girl", by Miss Marie Swelldon, published London, 1912.
It's all about the happy-go-lucky daughter of a Yorkshire mill owner and her
adventures marrying into the aristocracy.

>read poetry
Publishers talk a lot of nonsense about readers being transported away by books,
but somehow you have arrived in the...

Unreal City
This is a city side street, but as if seen through the grey of despair. People
stream by, some of whom you almost recognise, as if dead. The street runs east-
west, and to the north is a doorway into a grubby tenement building.

>w

Down by River
Down at the end of the street, the brown urban waters carry by unpleasant
rubbish, and rats scuttle up and over the mounds washed up around you.

On one especially repellent mound is, of all things, a fine silk handkerchief.

On the far bank is a glass-roofed tourist boat. As much as you like to explore,
you can't see how to attract its attention.

>d
You can't go that way.

>get silk
Taken.

>wave it
You wave the handkerchief, and the boat glides smoothly across the river toward
you.

>enter boat

On board the Phlebas
A tourist river-boat, glass-roofed. You can climb out to the shore to the east.
At the helm is a very strange man, at times almost a straw dummy, almost perhaps
a hollow cut-out made of paper. He (or it) turns the wheel and casts his eyes to
windward.

The hollow man mechanically says: "Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I
gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way
once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a
real place, like anywhere was real... We are the hollow men, I says, he didn't
like that... Hurry up, please, it's time."

>remove mask
You take off the gas mask.

>answer time
(to the hollow man)
You lose all sense of time and place as the boat drifts down river... It comes
as a considerable relief to your befuddled nerves when the man helps you off the
boat again, and you find yourself:

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew
House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house
rises up high above you to the south and you do not dare go east for fear of
being recaptured by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest,
deeper into the gardens.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

Was any of that real? you wonder, as you relax in the sunshine. But then you
realise you are clutching a tarot card which certainly is.

>nw

Family Tree
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought
back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream,
to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green
privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew House Maze. A
signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east.

>w

Clearing
A clearing at the edge of the garden, surrounded by walls and the privet hedges
of the maze. To the east is the plane tree, to the west an opening in the wall
makes a garage entrance and to the south is a small vegetable garden.

Garage
A modest brick garage, built into the garden walls. A big open doorway leads

Unreal City
This is a city side street, but as if seen through the grey of despair. People
stream by, some of whom you almost recognise, as if dead. The street runs east-
west, and to the north is a doorway into a grubby tenement building.

>n

Shadowy Hallway
A filthy wooden staircase leads up from here, off the street to the south.
Peeling-away posters have been stuck up on top of each other on the walls, in
such a way that you can only read the most recent.

Consulting Room
The stairs end at a shabby room, with screened windows, lit by incense sticks
and sevenbranched candelabra. A doorway with a hanging bead curtain leads west.
In the centre of the room is a table, on which is an electric bell push and a
wicked Tarot pack.

"First, this I must know, were you born in an even, or an odd, year?"

>answer odd

Madame Sosostris picks up the cards and deals them onto the table. She frowns in
concentration as the Star, the Maiden and then the Eight of Wands show. "You
have come!  At last, after all these centuries!  But there is little I can do to
ease your way, save to return the staff you left with me for safe keeping."  And
she shows you out. You feel rather bewildered.

This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room
of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't
bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the

Folly
This is a rampart on the hillside, a natural ledge leading east. Down below in
the valley, rough cottages surround a church. Labourers toil in the fields, and
a hay wain is being pulled across the river far below.

Towering over you is a monstrously awful piece of architecture, a Folly. The
freestanding tower has no appreciable purpose and no apparent entrance. The
latter is just as well since it looks extremely unsafe.

A bean pole, of the kind used to grow climbing plants, rests against the side of
the tower.

Ruined Castle Cafe
This crowded, bohemian cafe bears only a passing resemblance to the ruined
castle of the Tarot card: the decor imitates castle walls and arrowslits. You
find yourself sitting at a table for one in the centre of the cafe floor. It is
noisy, bustling and cheery, and a string quartet plays Strauss under the
chattering of German voices. Your chances of attracting a waiter are very
slight.

Over in one corner, you can see a little square window, behind which must be the
store of cups and glasses. Remembering this, you are distracted and unable to
enjoy the entertainment. Even the table is annoying. It must have one leg
shorter than the rest, or something, because it rattles now and then.

The table rattles again.

>look under table
Now don't panic, but there's a ticking bomb loosely taped to the underside of
the table you're sitting at!

The clock is ticking downwards, and has only 9 minutes to go before it hits the
red zone. All four wires are plugged into the timer.

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively
tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem
fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But
the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

Universe Maintenance Room
You really should try to be more awestruck, for this is Merlin's cave, the hub
of Creation. Every visitor perceives this place differently, according to his or
her own myths and beliefs. Your particular creed being science, it is an
unimpressive collection of gauges, dials and machines. A single passage leads up
and out to the south.

Particularly prominent are a large dial, like the volume control on an expensive

Sea Shore
A rough rocky sea shore below barely-climbable cliffs, against which an inviting
deep blue sea laps. It seems to be early morning, soon after dawn, from the look
of the sun on the water.

Chained to the cliff face is the beautiful Andromeda, looking nobly out to sea
as she awaits her fate.

>u

Cliffs
On top of some exposed cliffs on the Mediterranean. A dangerous slither down
leads on one side to the shore, all other ways down being even more hazardous.
Atop the cliffs is the Pharos tower, a round stone pinnacle lighthouse, but
there is no way in from here. A grassy walk leads east.

>e

Clifftop Walk
A long clifftop walk by the sea, from the lighthouse to the west to the village
not far east. These fields are occupied by herds of hardy mountain goats,
continually butting each other and frisking. To the south a path leads across
sparse grassland to a great outgrowth of some kind.

>s

Wall of Thorns
The rather sparse rolling landscape is dominated here by a massive, and
suspiciously unnatural, wall of thorns, which forms a great ring about an area
perhaps a hundred yards in diameter. There are goat pastures to the north.

The wall rustles and clashes its thorns like a beast alive.

Fire leaps out from the rod into the heart of the thorn wall, which screams out

tantalising glimpse of a great Temple, before the wall heals back. But it is
unable to recover entirely, and a charred gap is left to the south. You could
probably squeeze through it.

Sacred Earth
Here inside the thorn wall, a north-south path leads across sacred earth into
the imposing marble Temple of Zeus. You feel distinctly uneasy walking on such
hallowed turf. There are any number of myths about gods getting cross about that
sort of thing.

>s
Zeus, who is after all the chief of all the gods, appears and hurls a
thunderbolt down just before you begin to cross into the Temple. Astonishingly,
you beat the luck of the gods and slip into the temple just clear of the
thunderbolt. "Damn, missed!" says a sepulchral voice from without.

Temple of Zeus
The beautiful candle-lit Temple of Zeus, a cavern of marble pillars which is
quite empty and featureless save for the entrance at the north. So much for all
the rumours about hoards of treasure - it looks as if Zeus (who is, by the way
howling with anger outside) was bluffing all along.

You can see one copper coin here.

A plain but cheery taverna, fill of miserable and rather ashamed men who are
drinking retsina heavily. The day is dawning outside the north door, but they
strangely do not share your uplifted feeling at the sight.

Left untouched on one table is an Ekmek Special dessert.

Behind the bar, a depressed bartender polishes glasses.

Chained to the cliff face is the beautiful Andromeda, looking nobly out to sea
as she awaits her fate.

>give dessert to andromeda
She smiles as if to say there's not much point watching her waist-line any more,
and hungrily wolfs down her favourite dessert. As a gesture of thanks, she takes
off her amber hairband and hands it you. Quickly she readopts her noble pose,
however, just in case anyone else is looking.

which melts into the Rod of Sacrifice!

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-
made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good
strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues
along a passage east.

You can see a tourist map and a labelled glass demijohn (which is open but
empty) here.

You walk confidently into the south wall...

Lighthouse
You stand atop a pinnacle of stone, on an early Pharos, or lighthouse.
Inconsiderately enough, the builders have provided no obvious way down from
here. Still, there's a fine view out across the Mediterranean sea into the dim
dawning sun. It's going to be a nice day, you can't help thinking.

In the centre of the pinnacle is a marvellous device of polished bronze mirrors,
its open end pointed out across the bay. There seems to be very little traffic
at the moment, though a smudge on the horizon might possibly be a quinquireme.

>get flash

>put flash in device
You put the photographer's flash into the mirrored device.

You hear a sharp click!
The flash suddenly gives an enormous magnesium-flare flash, almost blinding in
its intensity. Your eyes take a little while to adjust. Consequently you can
only hear as the smudge on the horizon rises from the waves, becomes an enormous
Kraken sea monster and lunges for the stone tower. (Considering this is supposed
to be a Greek myth it feels surprisingly like a Japanese 1960s creature film.) 
The Kraken swipes at you, overreaches itself and falls over forward, impaling
itself extremely messily on the pharos. Your eyes just about recover by the time
the rest of your body is crushed by its weight.

Up on Mount Olympus, Zeus is still cross. "Take me to your Leda", you wittily
demand, but this does not seem to improve matters. Poseidon also looks rather
fed up, but luckily a sizeable faction of goddesses take your side and arrange
to have you resurrected...

Cobwebbed old cellars. There is nothing to see except an opening in one wall

handle on. The cellar continues west and south.

The dumbwaiter hangs on strong pulley ropes which stretch up and down from here.

Infinity Symbol
An eerie, dark cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and strewn with great
spiders' webs hung from the ragged stone, inhabited only by dead white insects.
A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the warmth of the house.

The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc
about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.

You shiver with foreboding, but inexplicably feel that the map you're looking
for must be somewhere near here.

Around the edge of the disc is a circular arc, surrounding the lemniscus, which
passes through seven equally spaced sockets or cylindrical wells.

>put returning, sacrifice, husbandry, fire, luck, bronze, stalking in arc

Murky Cave
This is a murky hillside cave, whose mouth opens to the northeast, though a
tight squeeze might lead a little way west. Outside is a clear starry night.
There is no traffic noise, and the air smells fresh.

Hanging up on an iron bracket is a flaming torch.

>get torch

Spur of Rock
An uncomfortable spur of rock on the hillside crags. The only natural access to
this spot is a crevice in the hill to the east, but there is also a securely
fastened rope hanging down into the darkness.

>d

Hanging on Rope
You are hanging perilously on a hemp rope, suspended from an overhang of rock
above, which drops down into the darkness of the valley. On the tracks below,
patrols of men can be heard, and you feel instinctively that they are not
friendly.

A single yellow daisy grows from a little tuft of grass on the crags.

>swing rope
You set the rope swinging back and forth. Very exhilarating!

Valley Prospect
The geography is strangely familiar here. You are on a natural shelf on the
hillside, overlooking the valley below. An all-but invisible cleft in the rock
leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be traversed to the
east.

It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp
frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires
illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign
of civilisation.

>e

Roman Villa
You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the
moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off
from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a
myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil war,
and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing. From
here you could cut across the hillside east to west, or slip in through a none-
too-secure timber door.

>s

Atrium Cloister
The shadowy cloisters of the villa's atrium. You disturb a fieldmouse, and hear
the scratching of tiny claws on stone. Moonlight filters in from the central
courtyard to the south, and a rotten timber door leads back north.

Resting against one pillar is a horn made from a tusk, mounted on a long spear-
like pole.

>get horn

>wave it
Light pulses from the daisy behind your ear, leaping out to engulf the summoning
horn which melts into the Rod of Language!

>strike rod
The rod charges up with etherial power, drawn up from the earth through ley

>point it at me
Nothing obvious happens. You curse eloquently in Celtic.

>s

Atrium
The central well of the villa, ringed with columns. On the north side is a
cloister and stone-linteled doorways lead east, south and west. The central
floor area is commanded by a beautiful Roman mosaic, quartered into individual
scenes, around the edges of which are vents from the hypocaust. There is no roof
over the courtyard, and the atrium is lit by moonlight.

>w

Guard Quarters
Whatever function this spacious room once had, now it is evidently home to
military men, for it is filled with crude armour, spears, rough blankets which
are little more than animal hides. Fortunately for you the guards are absent.

You can see a crude bone die and a pair of leather sandals here.

Triclinium
What was once the villa's triclinium, or kitchen, is now deserted and long since
ransacked for metal. (Nobody lives on their own in this century, and this villa
wouldn't be easy to defend.)  A doorway to the west gives onto the atrium.

In one corner is a hinged wooden cover of some kind, which is shut.

You peer at the kitchen well, which is open but empty.

Entrance
A well-flagstoned forecourt at the villa entrance, surrounded by lesser wooden
buildings. Some of these are in use as stables, and figures of men slip between
them. You hide from sight, not wishing to draw attention to yourself. Up on the
hill, where Meldrew House will one day be built, men on horseback can be seen
circling the access track. For a deserted villa, this is certainly well-guarded.

From up on the hill you hear the blowing of a horn.

Horses are approaching the villa, coming down the hill.

>d
Aware of the dangers, you very carefully lower yourself...

Inside Well
You are clinging perilously to the walls of the deep and dangerous well. You can
hardly see a thing, even with the aid of the torch, but curiously enough you
feel warm air blowing across you from the west.

There is definitely activity outside the villa.

>w

Hypocaust
This very low almost-cellar underneath the atrium is a tiny access space for log
fires which are kept going to provide a form of central heating for the villa.
They are lit and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very warm by
twentieth-century standards, but you have to admit it works. A tiny amount of
light filters in from the vents in the roof, but nowhere near enough to see by.
The only way in seems to be the way you came.

>z
Time passes.

>z
Time passes.

There is sudden activity as the guards make a thorough search of the villa, just
to be on the safe side. Luckily, they don't even think of looking down in here.

>z
Time passes.

You hear men walking across the mosaic just above your head.

>z
Time passes.

A voice, which can just be heard through the vent, says "Welcome, great masters.
We are convened in secret conclave to decide the fate of Britain. Lament, for
the old ways are passing!  There will be a dark age, a collapse into many
monarchies, and any man who can hold a town will call himself King and heir to
Vortigern."

>z
Time passes.

A younger, more impatient voice, says "This is an opportunity!  We must be the
power behind the thrones, we will in secret unite and be the true force of the
land..."

>z
Time passes.

There is cynical laughter for a moment, and a third voice interjects "And who
will lead this, this unity?  We take all sides and none, you know that. There
are potent druids in the tents of each general down there in the rabble. They'd
kill each other without hesitation on the battlefield."

>z
Time passes.

The first voice speaks once more. "Far worse is to come. The jumped-up kings and
their new men will no longer believe in the ancient powers. Already I can feel
the druidic magic weakening away, and we are perilously close to the nexus now.
In the valleys below, armies wait to fight the decisive battle. Whichever side
wins, they will no longer need us. In a matter of hours, the power will be
broken forever."

>z
Time passes.

After a sombre silence, a much older voice says "You did right to call us
together. There is a path prepared for us, but the sacrifice will be terrible.
We must concentrate all the remaining druidical energy into this sacred hill,
that it may last through all time, and we must ensure that druids live on this
site forever and keep the faith."

>z
Time passes.

The younger voice speaks again. "For now, yes, for a century or two, yes, but
what then?  They will forget the old ways, they will no longer truly be druids."

>z
Time passes.

The older voice replies triumphantly. "This is what must be done. They will
forget, so we must give them a substitute. We shall accurse them to always seek
after this magical stone, which it will be all but impossible for them to find.
It will take the form of whatever they most desire. In six hundred years, by my
prophecy, religious wars in the East will capture men's hearts, and then they
will think it is the Holy Grail, the cup which held the blood of Christ. A
thousand years later they will think it is -"  But at this moment the voices
move away.

>e

Inside Well

>u

Triclinium

The hinged wooden cover is raised, revealing a circular well about a yard in
diameter. It is very dark inside.

An industrious-looking slave (who cooks for the horsemen) is rather surprised to
see you, but with creditable presence of mind he summons the guard at once.

Suddenly you are thrust before a druidical figure. He seems to recognise you,
and is troubled. Perhaps because of this, your life is saved and you are taken
away into custody, down in the valley among the army encampments.

Rough Tent
Well, here you are, imprisoned again. This time the cell is a tent of stitched
animal hides, perhaps twenty feet in diameter, supported by a central pole. You
have no idea where the entrance is, because you were blindfolded on the way in.
There is at least a dim light from the camp-fires outside the tent.

>z
Time passes.

>z
Time passes.

>z
Time passes.

>z
Time passes.

Without warning a Saxon spy (or, as the guards would no doubt put it, another
Saxon spy) is thrown bodily into the tent, careering into the central pole and
slumping unconscious on the ground as a result. For a moment the whole tent
rocks with the force - the pole was nearly broken.

>get pole
As you uproot the tent-pole, the whole tent collapses ignominiously, the animal
hides falling about your head. The hides are heavy and weigh you down, but you
just manage to crawl out...

Encampment
Luckily for you the tent, now collapsed, was hardly being watched at all,
because all the attention is diverted to a ghastly ritual being carried out over
beyond the camp-fires. But your luck cannot hold for long. You are so surrounded
by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide. Things are,
not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim.

An erratic glacial rock, which seems in the feverish firelight to make a natural
dolmen, can be made out to the east, on the other side of an almost-extinguished
campfire of hot coals.

>wave it
Light pulses from the daisy behind your ear, leaping out to engulf the tent pole
which melts into the Rod of Returning!

>strike rod
The rod charges up with etherial power, drawn up from the earth through ley

>e
You cross the hot coals nimbly in your sandals.

Beneath Dolmen
You stand beside the eerie dolmen, surrounded by the terrible noises and
incantations of a druidic rite.

Resting on top of the dolmen is a polished blue stone.

>get stone

Light pulses from the daisy behind your ear, leaping out to engulf the bluish
stone which melts into a fifty-franc note!

Infinity Symbol
An eerie, dark cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and strewn with great
spiders' webs hung from the ragged stone, inhabited only by dead white insects.
A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the warmth of the house.

The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc
about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.

You shiver with foreboding, but inexplicably feel that the map you're looking
for must be somewhere near here.

You can see some old gardeners' gloves, a daisy chain, the Rod of Infinity and a
canvas rucksack (which is open and contains a delicate gold key, a weed killer
bottle, a silk handkerchief, a gas mask, a Tarot box (which is open but empty),
a small brass key, a ancient prayer book, a gothic-looking iron key, an electric
torch (providing light) (which is closed), an antique jewellery box (which is
open but empty), the History of the Meldrews (vol. II) and a postcard of the
Champs-Elysees) here.

Around the edge of the disc is a circular arc, surrounding the lemniscus, which
passes through seven equally spaced sockets or cylindrical wells.  All seven
sockets are occupied by rods.

A dry, desolate waste of buildings borders here on a main road, so full of
