Thank heaven for that.

The radio valves glow, and execrable so-called easy listening music fills the air with a sort of bland aural candy-floss.


>turn wireless off
It's already off.

The radio plays a easy-listening transcription of the Bugs Bunny theme tune.

Object Tree_Planting "Tree Planting"
  with  description "Capability Meldrew and his gang of workmen are 
            delicately planting a sapling plane tree here. Your

[has no light, so you'll move into the dark without one]

As you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some
distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?
   @set_attr Old Winery 25

This sets the general property. But there's some code segment:

[ OneTimeBonusScore unused ;    ! 59336 / 0xe7c8
    if (Old_Winery has general) {
        rtrue;
    }
    give Old_Winery general;
    StartTimer(Old_Winery,4);   ! not popped
    @pop;
    score = score + 5;
    good_try_bonus = true;
    "^A shame to see such a good try unrewarded... oh, go on, have an extra five points.";
];

This fails once you visit the winery. And if you do this before you visit the winery, the key message never appears

Family Tree
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a
single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew House Maze. A signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east.

The garden roller sits here, its engine still running.

You can also see a flaming torch (providing light) here.

>get in roller
You get into the garden roller.

It is now pitch dark in here!

>stand
You are on your own two feet again.

Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

Encampment
Luckily for you the tent, now collapsed, was hardly being watched at all, because all the attention is diverted to a ghastly ritual being carried out over beyond the camp-fires. But your luck cannot hold for
long. You are so surrounded by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide. Things are, not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim.

An erratic glacial rock, which seems in the feverish firelight to make a natural dolmen, can be made out to the east, on the other side of an almost-extinguished campfire of hot coals.

>get dolmen
Taken.

Rustles even if not a merlyn's hat:

"Let's see, the others have had theirs... I have only a few colours left. What would you like?"

>answer green
(to Jemima)
"Right you are then, I'm sure I have some which are just right."

After a moment she notices you're still here. "Come back later, it'll be done soon."  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile. Should have eaten the chocolates myself, you find yourself thinking.

>z.z.z.z.z.z.z.z.z.z
I only understood you as far as wanting to z.

"There we are!  All done now."  Jemima hangs a daisy chain around your neck, then frowns and adjusts your hair in an exceedingly annoying way.

>z
Time passes.

>i
You are carrying:
  a daisy chain (being worn) (which rustles as if with a magical wind)

>close trap door
You close the trapdoor, surprised to see that something shiny was obscured by it.

>get box
Taken.

>open trap door
You open the hinged trapdoor.

>i 
You are carrying:
  an antique jewellery box (which is closed)
  a crumpled piece of paper
  an electric torch (providing light) (which is closed)
  a chocolate biscuit
